# <img src="img/logo.svg" width="50" alt="CSV Validator Icon"> **Yet Another CSV Validators Combinator**
## Introduction
CSV-Validator is a csv validators combinator: combine multiple simple validators.

The main goal is to validate csv data in a streaming fashion, with the ability to fix the data on the fly.
Errors are reported with their location.

### How it works:
- read csv data from file or stream into stream buffers
- process lines from the buffers 
- apply validator functions on each line from a list of validator functions
- chain validators when fixing: each validator will return either the original line or the fixed line
- refactor on validation error:
  - from: when validator response is None, the program stops 
  - to: don't stop validating, but report errors and continue validating

### chaining vs parallel
In case of an error in the source data, you can choose to let your validator fix the data and pass the fixed data
downstream. In that case, the validators run chained.  When exclusively checking and not fixing, then the validators will run concurrently.

### validator types
#### format validators
These will check the format, ie. the number of columns, illegal characters, etc.
validators:
- [ ] column count
- [ ] illegal characters
- [ ] escape character

#### data validators
With the ability to pass in a schema, the data validators will check the data against the schema.
- [ ] data types against data library
- [ ] constraints

#### utilities
- [ ] separator detection, including multi-character separators
- [ ] quote detection

## Usage

## TODO

- [x] maximize local parallelism using rayon
- [ ] heuristic vs statistical analysis for separator
- [ ] allow to use a ray cluster for further parallelizing
- [ ] stream vs batch processing (ie. from kafka)
- [ ] implement kafka as sink for ie. spark streaming processing
- [ ] implement python interface
- [ ] add web example using wasm (data stays local)
